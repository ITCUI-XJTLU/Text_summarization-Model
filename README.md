###Document
As a beginner of artificial intelligence, I explored NLP field in 2020 winter holidy. This is the presentation of my project, which is used to automatically generate a text summary . Since I am new to text-summarization, there may be some mistakes in the project, so I appreciate any kind of advice and feedback. The project includes three different models: model 1 is simply based on word frequnce , model 2 is based on the Seq2Seq model, model 3 is only implemented by the attention method.
